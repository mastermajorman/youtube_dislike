# Youtube Dislike Button Count
A project to return the Youtube dislike button count back to those who wish to view it.

**Currently available platforms:**
- Chrome Web Store
- Firefox Add-On Store (PENDING APPROVAL)

**Future platforms:**
- Native Youtube app
- Gecko and Webkit-based browsers (I will ensure a version works for each)
- Outdated web browsers (by request)

**Known issues:**
- Since YouTube has not rolled out dislike hiding for all accounts, using this extension while dislikes are not hidden has small bugs. I will not fix these since they will be nullified come full rollout of dislike hiding.
