# Youtube Dislike Button Count
A project to return the Youtube dislike button count back to those who wish to view it.

## **Currently available platforms:**
- Chrome Web Store (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/youtube-dislike-button-co/mjnhacklcfliofhdgnkemmkioinkhcnk)
- Firefox Add-On Store (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/youtube-dislike-button-count/?utm_source=addons.mozilla.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=search)


## **Future platforms:**
- Native Youtube app
- Gecko and Webkit-based browsers (I will ensure a version works for each)
- Outdated web browsers (by request)

## **Active work:**
- Like/Dislike Sentiment bar

## **Known issues:**
- Since YouTube has not rolled out dislike hiding for all accounts, using this extension while dislikes are not hidden creates small bugs. I will not fix these since they will be nullified come full rollout of dislike hiding.
